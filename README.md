# web_parser
Make use of libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests. An illustration of how to extract and parse data from a webpage may be found here:
This script defines a function called search_website, which parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup after fetching it from the specified URL. It retrieves the results after looking for elements that contain the given search query.

Before running the code, don't forget to replace "https://example.com" with the URL you actually want to search and "search query" with the exact wording of your question. Furthermore, confirm that you have used pip to install the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries:

- pip install requests
- pip install beautifulsoup4
